    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fresh green maize (shelled)</li>
      <li>Young tender leaves of a pumpkin and/or Spinach.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>Irish Potatoes</li>
      <li>Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>3 cups of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Boil green maize for at least two hours or until they are cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the peeled and diced potatoes but do not mix. Place the thoroughly washed pumpkin leaves on top of the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some salts.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture boil for another 30 minutes to 45 minutes until the potatoes and the greens are well cooked. Remember, never stir this mixture otherwise you will make a mess out of your Mukimo.</li>
        <li>Once satisfied that the maize, potatoes and greens are well cooked, drain the remaining water and let the mixture simmer under low heat.</li>
        <li>Mix and mash the mixture. Add some margarine to give the Mukimo a delicate flavour. Ensure that the maize, potatoes and pumpkin leaves are evenly spread.
        </li>
        <li>The final product should have a very fine texture, is light green in colour and should neither be dry nor very moist. Some people like it when the maize remains intact(whole).</li>
    </ol>
